<H2> We Need Sponsorship!</H2>
<p class="sponsorstext"> We are a competitive team that win at Natinal level but we are now in desperate need of funds to purchase replacement equipment. 
With your sponsorship, we can purchase new parts and compete at higher levels such as the Irish national and world championships events. If you give us sponsorship, we would advertise you by putting your logo on our t-shirts/posters, have your name on our website and YouTube videos, mention you in interviews and much more. Just imagine ( your business) on the front of the newspaper ‘Cork School qualifies to worlds only for the help of ( your business)’. We can even name our robot after your firm.
